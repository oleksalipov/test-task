## Description

Hi Sam, here's my test assignment. It covers all the scenarios you've sent and runs on Docker. 

For your convenience, I've included instructions for running the docker container, too

## Installation

- Install Docker
- In Terminal, navigate to the folder containing my project
- Run 'docker build -t test-task .'
- Run 'docker run test-task ' 

## Usage

- Docker will automatically execute the Cypress test run 
- Sit back and enjoy! :)
